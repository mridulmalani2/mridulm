# Golden derivation record (Phase B1)

**Method** (PHASE_B amendment, 2026-07-05): the reference derivation is
`scripts/goldens/spec_calc.py` — a SPEC-literal Python implementation (different language
from the engine, zero repo imports). Each `G*/expected.json` + `schedule.csv` is its
committed output; `tests/goldens.test.ts` re-runs the script and fails on any drift, and
re-asserts the 22 SPEC §17 assertions in CI.

**Line → SPEC mapping**: every block of spec_calc.py carries its SPEC section marker
(§2 S&U/plug · §3 waterfall & running-cash · §4 beginning-balance interest, max(base,floor)+spread,
PIK on beginning balance · §6 two-pool tax state machine incl. loss branch, §382, floor ·
§7 margin trajectory / NWC days / split OID vs fee amortization pro-rata by commitment ·
§8 opening BS + goodwill plug + PP&E roll, per-year close asserted < $0.005m ·
§9 exit equity = EV − payoff + cash − fees; three return streams per the fee-membership table ·
§10 promote = min(pool × max(0, proceeds − hurdle × invested), exit equity)).

**Assertion results (2026-07-05)**: 22/22 pass — G1 closed-form check values exact
(sponsor 209.0 / FCF 16.5 / exit equity 284.5 / MOIC 1.3612 / IRR 6.3622%); G2 §163(j)
positive headroom all years, revolver undrawn, sweep pool positive; G2-D IRR 8.88% vs base
13.19% with S&U byte-identical (entry frozen); G3 §163(j) binds all 5 years, carryforward
10.06→28.79 monotone, PIK payoff 237.92, promote in the money (17.36); G4 Y1 banks 1.81
post-close NOL, 15% floor binds Y2–Y3, §382 caps acquired usage at 3.0 from Y3, acquired
pool ends 28.88; G5 revolver draws 3.62 in Y1 (closing cash = floor 4.0), repaid by Y3,
no breach.

**Adjudication (PHASE_B rule — second independent pass)**: recorded below by the
adjudicating agents; a golden is gospel only after this section is signed.

- [x] **Adjudication pass 1 (2026-07-05, run wf_01aabc2d, agent a6f29b1): SIGNED.** 60 lines
  hand-re-derived from SPEC (G3 Y1 complete incl. S&U/goodwill/tax/waterfall/BS-close;
  G5 Y1 waterfall incl. the draw-to-floor) — zero mismatches beyond ±$0.005m.
- [x] **Adjudication pass 2 (2026-07-05, run wf_01aabc2d, agent a176fad): SIGNED.** 107 lines
  (G4 tax state machine Y1–Y3 incl. loss banking, 80%/§382 double cap, 15% floor; G2 Y1
  complete; G1 all five closed-form values) — zero mismatches beyond ±$0.005m.

Ambiguities the adjudicators resolved (all confirmed by fixtures, now stated in SPEC
v1.0.2): golden defaults ati_pct 30% / min_rate 0 / rollover 0; commitment fee on
beginning-of-year undrawn; NWC[0] = pct × facts revenue. Note: expected.json stores 2dp
display values — differences of exactly 0.005 vs full-precision hand derivation are
display rounding at the tolerance boundary, not engine values.

**Status: G1–G5 + G2-D are GOSPEL. Engine2 modules (Phase C) are wrong wherever they
disagree with these fixtures; disputes reopen only via spec amendment + re-derivation.**
